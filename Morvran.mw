The [[bird]] [[family (biology)|family]] '''Phalacrocoracidae''' is represented by some 40 [[species]] of '''cormorants and shags'''. Several different classifications of the family have been proposed recently, and the number of [[Genus|genera]] is disputed.

== Names ==
There is no consistent distinction between cormorants and shags.  The names "cormorant" and "shag" were originally the common names of the two species of the family found in [[Great Britain]], ''Phalacrocorax carbo'' (now referred to by ornithologists as the [[Great Cormorant]]) and ''P. aristotelis'' (the [[Common Shag]]). "Shag" refers to the bird's crest, which the British forms of the Great Cormorant lack.  As other species were discovered by [[English language|English-speaking]] sailors and explorers elsewhere in the world, some were called cormorants and some shags, depending on whether they had crests or not. Sometimes the same species is called a cormorant in one part of the world and a shag in another, e.g., the Great Cormorant is called the Black Shag in [[New Zealand]] (the birds found in [[Australasia]] have a crest that is absent in [[Europe]]an members of the species). [[Gerard Frederick van Tets|Van Tets]] (1976) proposed to divide the family into two [[genus|genera]] and attach the name "Cormorant" to one and "Shag" to the other, but this flies in the face of common usage and has not been widely adopted.

The scientific [[genus]] name is [[latin]]ized [[Ancient Greek]], from ''φαλακρός'' (''phalakros'', "bald") and ''κόραξ'' (''korax'', "raven"). This is often thought to refer to the creamy white patch on the cheeks of adult [[Great Cormorant]]s, or the ornamental white head plumes prominent in Mediterranean birds of this species, but is certainly not a unifying characteristic of cormorants. "Cormorant" is a [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] derived from Latin ''corvus marinus'', "sea raven". Indeed, "sea raven" or analogous terms were the usual terms for cormorants in [[Germanic languages]] until after the [[Middle Ages]].  The French explorer [[André Thévet]] commented in 1558 that "...the beak [is] similar to that of a cormorant or other corvid," which demonstrates that the erroneous belief that the birds were related to ravens lasted at least to the 16th century.

== Characteristics ==
Cormorants and shags are medium-to-large [[seabird]]s. They range in size from the [[Pygmy Cormorant]] (''Phalacrocorax pygmaeus''), at as little as 45&nbsp;cm (18 in) and 340 g (12 oz), to the [[Flightless Cormorant]] (''Phalacrocorax harrisi''), at a maximum size 100&nbsp;cm (40 in) and 5&nbsp;kg (11 lb). The recently-extinct [[Spectacled Cormorant]] (''Phalacrocorax perspicillatus'') was rather larger, at an average size of 6.3&nbsp;kg (14 lb). The majority, including nearly all Northern Hemisphere species, have mainly dark [[Feather|plumage]], but some Southern Hemisphere species are black and white, and a few (e.g. the [[Spotted Shag]] of [[New Zealand]]) are quite colourful. Many species have areas of coloured skin on the face (the [[lore]]s and the [[gular skin]]) which can be bright blue, orange, red or yellow, typically becoming more brightly coloured in the breeding season. The bill is long, thin, and sharply hooked. Their feet have webbing between all four toes, as in their relatives.

[[Image:Cormorant-island-752.jpg|thumb|242px|Cormorants nesting on an island at [[Walthamstow Reservoirs]]]]
They are coastal rather than oceanic birds, and some have colonised inland waters - indeed, the original ancestor of cormorants seems to have been a fresh-water bird, judging from the habitat of the most ancient lineage. They range around the world, except for the central [[Pacific]] islands.

All are [[fish]]-eaters, dining on small [[eel]]s, fish, and even water [[snake]]s. They dive from the surface, though many species make a characteristic half-jump as they dive, presumably to give themselves a more streamlined entry into the water. Under water they propel themselves with their feet. Some cormorant species have been found, using [[depth gauge]]s, to dive to depths of as much as 45 metres.

After fishing, cormorants go ashore, and are frequently seen holding their wings out in the sun. All cormorants have preen gland secretions that are used ostensibly to keep the feathers waterproof. Some sources<ref>Cramp S, Simmons KEL 1977 Handbook of the Birds of the Western Palearctic Volume 1, Oxford University Press</ref> state that cormorants have waterproof feathers while others say that they have water ''permeable'' feathers.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=J.

Cormorants are colonial nesters, using trees, rocky islets, or cliffs. The [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s are a chalky-blue colour. There is usually one brood a year. The young are fed through [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]]. They typically have deep, ungainly bills, showing a greater resemblance to those of the [[pelican]]s', to which they are related, than is obvious in the adults.

== Systematics==
The cormorants are a group traditionally placed within the [[Pelecaniformes]] or, in the [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]], the expanded [[Ciconiiformes]]. This latter group is certainly not a natural one, and even after the [[tropicbird]]s have been recognized as quite distinct, the remaining Pelecaniformes seem not to be entirely [[monophyletic]]. Their relationships and delimitation - apart from being part of a "higher waterfowl" [[clade]] which is similar but not identical to Sibley and Ahlquist's "pan-Ciconiiformes" - remain mostly unresolved.

Notwithstanding, all evidence agrees that the cormorants and shags are closer to the [[darter]]s and [[Sulidae]] (gannets and boobies), and perhaps the [[pelican]]s and/or even [[penguin]]s, than to all other living birds<ref>Kennedy ''et al.'' (2000), Mayr (2005)</ref>. In recent years, three preferred treatments have emerged: either to leave all living cormorants in a single genus, '''''Phalacrocorax''''', or to split off a few species like the [[Imperial Shag]] complex (in ''Leucocarbo'') and perhaps the [[Flightless Cormorant]]. Alternatively, the genus may be disassembled altogether and in the most extreme case be reduced to the [[Great Cormorant|Great]], [[White-breasted Cormorant|White-breasted]] and [[Temminck's Cormorant]]s.<ref>See Siegel-Causey (1988), Orta (1992) and Kennedy ''et al.'' (2000) for a review of classification schemes.</ref>

Pending a thorough review of the Recent and prehistoric cormorants, the single-genus approach<ref name = orta1992>Orta (1992)</ref> is followed here for three reasons: First, it is preferable to tentatively assigning genera without a robust hypothesis. Second, it makes it easier to deal with the fossil forms, the systematic treatment of which has been no less controversial than that of living cormorants and shags. Third, this scheme is also used by the [[IUCN]]<ref>IUCN (2007)</ref>, making it easier to incorporate data on status and conservation. In accordance with the treatment there, the Imperial Shag complex is here left unsplit too, but the King Shag complex is split up.

Several [[evolution]]ary groups are still recognizable. However, combining the available evidence suggests that there has also been a great deal of [[convergent evolution]]; for example the "cliff shags" are a convergent [[paraphyletic]] group. The proposed division into ''Phalacrocorax sensu stricto'' (or [[subfamily]] '''Phalacrocoracinae''') "cormorants" and ''Leucocarbo sensu lato'' (or '''Leucocarboninae''') "shags"<ref>van Tets (1976), Siegel-Causey (1988)</ref> does indeed have some degree of merit - though not as originally intended - but fails to account for [[basal (biology)|basal]] lineages and the fact that the entire family cannot be clearly divided at present beyond the [[superspecies]] or species-complex level<ref name = kennedyetal2000>Kennedy ''et al.'' (2000)</ref>. The resolution provided by the [[mtDNA]] [[12S rRNA]] and [[ATPase]] [[subunit]]s 6 and 8 [[DNA sequence|sequence]] data<ref name = kennedyetal2000 /> is not sufficient to properly resolve several groups to satisfaction; in addition, many species remain unsampled, the fossil record has not been integrated in the data, and the effects of hybridization - known in some [[Pacific]] species especially - on the DNA sequence data are unstudied.

[[Image:Cormoran gris en Puesto del japones.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The peculiar [[Red-footed Shag]] (''Phalacrocorax gaimardi'')]]
This list attempts to follow a [[phylogenetic]] order<ref>Based on Orta (1992) and Kennedy ''et al.'' (2000). Applicable genus names are from Dorst & Mougin (1979) and Orta (1992)</ref>. If the distinction into subfamilies would be upheld, the "blue-eyed" and related species would probably be the Leucocarboninae, and the groups that follow them the Phalacrocoracinae. The first two lineages (and possibly the Flightless Cormorant) are basal and cannot be assigned to either subfamily.

'''Basal lineage 1:''' "Microcormorants", proposed genus '''''Microcarbo''''' or ''Halietor'' ("Phalacrocoracinae"); the former genus name would be valid.
:Small, short-billed subtropical to tropical marine and freshwater species from the [[Old World]] and [[Australia]]. They have black feet and almost all lack significant white feathers. They often have a diminutive frontal tuft.

* [[Pygmy Cormorant]], ''Phalacrocorax pygmaeus''

'''Basal lineage 2:''' Red-footed Shag. Included in ''Leucocarbo'' or ''Stictocarbo'' ("Leucocarboninae")
:Pacific coast of [[South America]]. This species apparently has no close living relatives. It has a highly [[apomorph]]ic color pattern: naked red base of bill, red feet, and a white neck spot, and it is crestless. It seems to be convergent in some aspects with the ''punctatus'' superspecies. What seems sure by now is that this species must be placed in a distinct [[monotypic]] genus '''''Poikilocarbo''''' in almost any case, if any species are split from ''Phalacrocorax'' at all.<ref>Much of Phalacrocoracidae systematics hinges upon this most enigmatic species. The white neck spots and general coloration are very much unlike that of any other living cormorant, though [[anatomical]]ly it is quite similar to the species composing the ''punctatus'' superspecies, which are also the only other members of this family with a grey background color. No satisfying theory has been proposed to explain this oddity.</ref>

'''Blue-eyed shags and relatives:''' variously placed in ''Euleucocarbo'', ''Hypoleucos'', ''Leucocarbo'', ''Notocarbo'' and ''Stictocarbo''  ("Leucocarboninae")
:This reasonably well-supported marine [[clade]] contains 3 lineages:
:#One containing American species which are black-footed, black-plumaged, and have yellow skin at the base of the bill as well as white display crests behind the eyes in breeding plumage. They occur in marine and freshwater habitats. If considered a genus, they would get the name '''''Dilophalieus'''''.
:#The [[Rock Shag]] from southern South America with red skin at the bill base, pink feet, a frontal crest, and an apomorphic white ear-spot
:#A group of numerous close-knit forms from southern Pacific and [[subantarctic]] waters which are white below with pink feet but otherwise quite varying in appearance. It contains the King and Imperial complexes and the Guanay Cormorant. Almost all have some amount of white on the upperwing coverts, frontal crests, and blue eye-rings. The crested shags with yellow warts in front of the eyes belong to this group. The genus name '''''Leucocarbo''''' would apply to either this group, or the entire clade.
* [[Double-crested Cormorant]] or White-crested Cormorant, ''Phalacrocorax auritus''

[[Image:Brandt's Cormorant Alcatraz.JPG|thumb|220px|[[Brandt's Cormorant]] (''Phalacrocorax penicillatus'') - crestless, but with ornamental plumes]]
'''North Pacific shags:''' spread between '''''Compsohalieus''''' ("Phalacrocoracinae") and ''Stictocarbo'' ("Leucocarboninae"). If a distinct genus, the former name would apply
:A well-supported marine group ranging from the [[Bering Strait]] to [[California]]. They are black-footed and have white ornamental plumes strewn about the head and neck in breeding plumage. They tend to have prominent double crests.

* [[Pelagic Cormorant]] or Baird's Cormorant, ''Phalacrocorax pelagicus''
* [[Red-faced Cormorant]], ''Phalacrocorax urile''

'''Common Shag lineage:''' formerly in ''Compsohalieus'' ("Phalacrocoracinae") and ''Stictocarbo'' ("Leucocarboninae")
:Black-footed smallish marine shags of Europe and southern Africa. Wahlberg's Cormorant is very tentatively placed here; it seems anatomically more similar to the ''P. fuscscens'', but the more informative characters - the combination of frontal crest and lack of extensive naked skin at bill base in mid-sized Old World species - seem to place it here. If this is correct, they are probably very distantly related due to [[biogeography]].
* [[Common Shag]], ''Phalacrocorax aristotelis''
* [[Wahlberg's Cormorant]] or Bank Cormorant, '' Phalacrocorax neglectus'' - tentatively placed here<ref>According to Dorst & Mougin (1979), close to the [[Cape Cormorant]] and possibly the spotted group. Orta (1992) disagrees - see HBW sequence [[#Species in HBW sequence|above]] - but does not give details. As this species and the Cape Cormorant occupy ranges that almost entirely overlap, it is not too likely that they are closely related. If they were, their ancestors would probably have at one time been restricted to [[refugia]] and afterwards, expanding their ranges again, evolved into a striking case of [[character displacement]].</ref>

'''Indian Ocean group:''' spread between ''Hypoleucos'' and ''Leucocarbo'' ("Leucocarboninae") and ''Compsohalieus'' ("Phalacrocoracinae"). '''''Hypoleucos''''' would be the correct genus name if they were split off.
[[Image:Littleblackcormorant.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Little Black Cormorant]], ''Phalacrocorax sulcirostris'']]
:A group of black-footed species occurring in tropical coastal or inland [[habitat]] between the [[Persian Gulf]] and Australia. Most species are tentatively assigned here, based on the combination of range, crestlessness, size, general lack of naked skin ornaments and the presence of some amount of white feathering in the ear region at least in breeding plumage. This clade is not too well supported, but this may be because the two presumed members included in recent research<ref name="kennedyetal2000"/> are quite dissimilar; the three unstudied ones are very similar to one or the other<ref name = orta1992 />.
* [[Little Black Cormorant]], ''Phalacrocorax sulcirostris''
* [[Indian Cormorant]], ''Phalacrocorax fuscicollis'' - tentatively placed here
* [[Socotran Cormorant]], ''Phalacrocorax nigrogularis'' - tentatively placed here
* [[Pied Cormorant]] or Yellow-faced Cormorant, ''Phalacrocorax varius''
* [[Black-faced Cormorant]], ''Phalacrocorax fuscescens'' - tentatively placed here

'''Spotted group:''' placed in '''''Stictocarbo''''' ("Leucocarboninae"); indeed, they would be the only members of this possibly distinct genus
:A superspecies of the [[New Zealand]] region. Peculiarly apomorphic, with yellowish legs, prominent double crests, white ornamental plumes on the neck, a grey belly and spotted wings.
* [[Spotted Shag]] ''Phalacrocorax punctatus''
* [[Pitt Cormorant]] or Featherstone's Shag '' Phalacrocorax featherstoni ''

'''Cape Cormorant:''' sometimes placed in ''Leucocarbo'' ("Leucocarboninae")
:Highly [[plesiomorph]]ic among its relatives; a species from the southern coasts of Africa. It is apparently close to the common ancestor of the next group and, perhaps apart from the all-black plumage, looks almost identical to that long-extinct bird.
* [[Cape Cormorant]], ''Phalacrocorax capensis''

[[Image:Phalacrocorax carbo02.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Great Cormorant]] (''Phalacrocorax carbo'') drying its wings]]
'''True cormorants:''' these would be retained in '''''Phalacrocorax''''' no matter how the cormorants and shags are split up
:They occur from the western Atlantic through the Old World into Australia, usually but not always in marine and temperate to subtropical habitat. They are characteristic, being large, with white cheek and thigh patches, ornamental plumes in the neck, a yellow naked bill base, black feet, and a shaggy nape crest.
* [[Great Cormorant]], ''Phalacrocorax carbo''
* [[White-breasted Cormorant]], ''Phalacrocorax lucidus''
* [[Temminck's Cormorant]] or Japanese Cormorant, '' Phalacrocorax capillatus''

'''''Incertae sedis:''''' Occasionally placed in the [[monotypic]] genus '''''Nannopterum''''', alternatively ''Compsohalieus'' ("Phalacrocoracinae") or ''Leucocarbo'' ("Leucocarboninae")
:The relationships of this species remain unresolved. Confined to the [[Galapagos Islands]], its wings have been reduced by [[evolution]] to tiny size. It is extremely apomorphic due to its flightlessness, and its plumage is entirely nondescript. It might be a derivative of the North Pacific lineage, or even the only cormorant somewhat closer to the Red-footed Shag.
