Originally based in [[mainland China]], the Republic of China now governs the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]] (formerly known as "Formosa"), which makes up over 99% of its territory,{{efn|The island of Taiwan covers an area of {{convert|36008|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}, while the total area under the jurisdiction of the ROC ([[Free Area of the Republic of China|Free Area]]) covers around {{convert|36193|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name="taiwan-popstat"/>}} as well as [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], and [[List of islands of the Republic of China|other minor islands]].

The island of Taiwan was mainly inhabited by [[Taiwanese aborigines]] until the [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch period]] in the 17th century when ethnic Chinese began immigrating to the island. The [[Qing Dynasty]] of China later conquered Taiwan in 1683. By the time Taiwan was ceded to [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] in 1895, the majority of Taiwan's inhabitants were [[Han Chinese]] either by ancestry or by assimilation. The [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) was established in China in 1912. At the end of World War II in 1945, Japan [[General Order No. 1|surrendered Taiwan to ROC military forces]] on behalf of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Following the [[Chinese civil war]], the [[Communist Party of China]] took full control of [[mainland China]] and founded the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. The ROC relocated its government to Taiwan, and its jurisdiction became limited to [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan and its surrounding islands]]. In 1971, the PRC assumed [[China and the United Nations|China's seat at the United Nations]], which the ROC originally occupied. [[Diplomatic recognition|International recognition]] of the ROC has gradually eroded as most countries switched recognition to the PRC. Only {{Numrec|ROC||UN member states}} and the [[Holy See]] currently maintain formal [[diplomatic relations]] with the ROC, though it has informal ties with most other states via its [[Taipei Representative Office|representative offices]].

Constitutionally, the ROC government has claimed sovereignty over all of "China", in a definition that includes mainland China and [[Outer Mongolia]], as well as Taiwan,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/china-taiwan-relations/2012/03/26/335822/1-country.htm |title='1 country, 2 areas' in line with ROC Constitution: MAC deputy |newspaper=China Post |date=26 March 2012 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref> but has not made retaking mainland China a political goal since 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://english.president.gov.tw/Default.aspx?tabid=1118 |title = Chapter XIII.

Meanwhile, the PRC also asserts itself to be the [[One China policy|sole legal representation of China]] and claims [[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Taiwan as its 23rd province]] to be under its sovereignty, [[political status of Taiwan|denying the status and existence of ROC]] as a sovereign state.

There are various names for the island of Taiwan in use today, derived from explorers or rulers by each particular period. The former name '''Formosa''' (福爾摩沙) dates from 1544, when [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] sailors sighted the main island of Taiwan and named it ''Ilha Formosa'', which means "Beautiful Island".<ref name="yb:history">{{cite book |title=The Republic of China Yearbook |url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/ |chapter=Chapter 3: History |chapterurl=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/docs/ch03.pdf |pages=41–53 |publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China (Taiwan) |year=2011}}</ref>
In the early 17th century, the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a commercial post at [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]] (modern [[Anping, Tainan]]) on a coastal islet called "Tayouan" in the local [[Siraya language]]; the name was later extended to the whole island as "Taiwan".<ref name="Oosterhoff">{{cite book |title=Colonial Cities: Essays on Urbanism in a Colonial Context |editor1-first=Robert |editor1-last=Ross |editor2-first=Gerard J. |editor2-last=Telkamp |chapter=Zeelandia, a Dutch colonial city on Formosa (1624–1662) |first=J.L. |last=Oosterhoff |pages=51–62 |publisher=Springer |year=1985 |isbn=978-90-247-2635-6}}</ref>
Historically, "Taiwan" has also been written as {{linktext|大灣}}, {{linktext|臺員}}, {{linktext|大員}}, {{linktext|臺圓}}, {{linktext|大圓}} and {{linktext|臺窩灣}}.

The official name of the [[sovereign state|state]] is the "Republic of China"; it has also been known under various names throughout its existence. Shortly after the ROC's establishment in 1912, while it was still located on the Asian mainland, the government used the abbreviation "China" ("''Zhongguó''") to refer to itself. During the 1950s and 1960s, it was common to refer to it as "Nationalist China" (or "Free China") to differentiate it from "Communist China" (or "Red China").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Garver|first=John W. |title=The Sino-American Alliance: Nationalist China and American Cold War Strategy in Asia|publisher=M.E. Sharp|date=April 1997|isbn=978-0-7656-0025-7|url=http://books.google.com/?id=SDqjW8G5H4cC}}</ref> It was present at the UN under the name "China" until 1971, when it [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|lost its seat]] to the People's Republic of China. Since then, the name "China" has been commonly used internationally to refer only to the People's Republic of China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/ch3.html|title=The Birth of the Republic of China|publisher=Government Information Office, ROC}}{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>
Over subsequent decades, the Republic of China has become commonly known as "Taiwan", after the island that composes most of its territory. The Republic of China participates in most international forums and organizations under the name "[[Chinese Taipei]]" due to diplomatic pressure from the PRC. For instance, it is the name under which it has competed at the Olympic Games since 1979, and its name as an observer at the [[World Health Organization]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/05/18/idUSLI62888|title=Taiwan hopes WHO assembly will help boost its profile|author=Katie Reid|publisher=Reuters|date=May 18, 2009|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}</ref>

More than 4,000 years ago farmers from mainland China, believed to be the ancestors of current [[Taiwanese aborigine]]s, settled on Taiwan. Their languages belong to the [[Austronesian language family]], which also includes the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] spanning a huge area from [[Madagascar]] to [[Easter Island]]. The aboriginal languages on Taiwan show much greater diversity than the rest of Austronesian put together, leading linguists to propose Taiwan as the [[Urheimat]] of the family, from which seafaring peoples dispersed across southeast Asia and the Pacific and Indian Oceans.<ref name="ref1">{{cite journal | title=Taiwan's gift to the world | last=Diamond | first=Jared M | authorlink=Jared Diamond | year=2000 | url=http://faculty.washington.edu/plape/pacificarchwin06/readings/Diamond%20nature%202000.pdf | format=PDF | journal=Nature | volume=403 | pages=709–710 | doi=10.1038/35001685 | pmid=10693781 | issue=6771 }}</ref><ref>{{cite conference | last=Fox | first=James J | url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/43158/2/Comparative_Austronesian_Studies.pdf | format=PDF | title=Current Developments in Comparative Austronesian Studies | booktitle=Symposium Austronesia |location=Universitas Udayana, Bali | year=2004}}</ref>

In 1626, the Spanish landed on and occupied northern Taiwan, at the ports of [[Keelung]] and [[Tamsui]], as a base to extend their trading. This colonial period lasted sixteen years until 1642, when the last Spanish fortress fell to Dutch forces.

Following the fall of the [[Ming Dynasty]], [[Koxinga]] (Zheng Chenggong), a self-styled Ming loyalist, arrived on the island and captured Fort Zeelandia in 1662, expelling the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch government]] and military from the island. Koxinga established the Kingdom of Tungning (1662–1683), with his capital at [[Tainan]]. He and his heirs, [[Zheng Jing]], who ruled from 1662 to 1682, and [[Zheng Keshuang]], who ruled less than a year, continued to launch raids on the south-east coast of mainland China well into the [[Qing Dynasty]].<ref name="Wills"/>

In 1683, following the defeat of Koxinga's grandson by an armada led by Admiral [[Shi Lang]] of southern Fujian, the [[Qing]] formally annexed Taiwan, placing it under the jurisdiction of Fujian province. The Qing imperial government tried to reduce piracy and vagrancy in the area, issuing a series of edicts to manage immigration and respect aboriginal land rights. Immigrants mostly from southern Fujian continued to enter Taiwan. The border between taxpaying lands and "savage" lands shifted eastward, with some aborigines becoming [[Sinicization|Sinicized]] while others retreated into the mountains. During this time, there were a number of conflicts between [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] from different regions of southern Fujian, and between southern Fujian Chinese and aborigines.<ref name="yb:history"/>

Northern Taiwan and the Penghu Islands were the scene of subsidiary campaigns in the [[Sino-French War]] (August 1884 to April 1885). The French occupied Keelung on 1 October 1884, but were [[Battle of Tamsui|repulsed from Tamsui]] a few days later. The French won some tactical victories but were unable to exploit them and the [[Keelung Campaign]] ended in stalemate. The [[Pescadores Campaign]], beginning on 31 March 1885, was a French victory, but had no long-term consequences. The French evacuated both Keelung and the Penghu archipelago after the end of the war.

In 1885, the Qing redesignated [[Taiwan Prefecture]] of [[Fujian]] as [[Taiwan Province]], the twentieth in the empire, with its capital at [[Taipei]].<ref name="yb:history"/> This was accompanied by a modernization drive that included building Taiwan's first railroad and starting a postal service.<ref>{{cite web |year=2006 |title=Build History of Main Routes of Taiwan Railway |work=Taiwan Railway Administration |url=http://www.railway.gov.tw/n/n1_01.htm |accessdate=6 March 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060218073123/http://www.railway.gov.tw/n/n1_01.htm Taiwan Railway Administration |archivedate = 18 February 2006}}</ref>

The Qing Dynasty was defeated in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–1895) and Taiwan and Penghu were [[Treaty of Shimonoseki|ceded in full sovereignty]] to the [[Empire of Japan]].

Initially, the United States abandoned the KMT and expected that Taiwan would fall to the Communists. However, in 1950 the conflict between [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]], which had been ongoing since the Japanese withdrawal in 1945, escalated into full-blown war, and in the context of the Cold War, US President [[Harry S.

As the Chinese Civil War continued without truce, the government built up military fortifications throughout Taiwan. Within this effort, former KMT soldiers built the now famous [[Central Cross-Island Highway]] through the [[Taroko Gorge]] in the 1950s. The two sides would continue to engage in sporadic military clashes with seldom publicized details well into the 1960s on the nearby islands with an unknown number of [[Project National Glory|night raids]]. During the [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]] in September 1958, Taiwan's landscape saw [[Nike-Hercules missile]] batteries added, with the formation of the 1st Missile Battalion Chinese Army that would not be deactivated until 1997. Newer generations of missile batteries have since replaced the Nike Hercules systems throughout the island.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the ROC maintained an authoritarian, single-party government while its economy became industrialized and technology oriented. This rapid economical growth, known as the [[Taiwan Miracle]], was the result of a fiscal regime independent from mainland China and backed up, among others, by the support of US funds and demand for Taiwanese products.<ref name="bbctimeline-coldwar">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/asia_pacific/2000/taiwan_elections2000/1955_1972.stm|title=Taiwan Timeline&nbsp;– Cold war fortress|year=2002|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-07-02}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Makinen|Woodward|1989}}: "Yet, the Chinese Nationalist government attempted to isolate Taiwan from the mainland inflation by creating it as an independent currency area.

Up until the 1970s, the government was regarded by Western critics as undemocratic for upholding martial law, for severely repressing any political opposition and for controlling media.

===Democratization===
{{Main|History of Taiwan#Democratic reforms|l1=Democratic reforms}}
[[File:Chiang Kai-shek memorial amk.jpg|thumb|[[Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall]]]]
[[Chiang Ching-kuo]], [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s son and successor as the president, began to liberalize the political system in the mid-1980s. In 1984, the younger Chiang selected [[Lee Teng-hui]], a Taiwanese-born, U.S.-educated technocrat, to be his vice president. In 1986, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) was formed and inaugurated as the first opposition party in the ROC to counter the KMT. A year later Chiang Ching-kuo lifted martial law on the main island of Taiwan (martial law was lifted on Penghu in 1979, Matsu island in 1992 and Kinmen island in 1993). With the advent of democratization, the issue of the [[political status of Taiwan]] gradually resurfaced as a controversial issue (previously, discussion of anything other than unification under the ROC was [[taboo]]).

After the death of Chiang Ching-kuo in January 1988, Lee Teng-hui succeeded him as president. Lee continued to democratize the government and decrease the concentration of government authority in the hands of mainland Chinese. Under Lee, Taiwan underwent a process of [[Taiwanese localization movement|localization]] in which Taiwanese culture and history were promoted over a pan-China viewpoint in contrast to earlier KMT policies which had promoted a Chinese identity. Lee's reforms included printing banknotes from the Central Bank rather than the Provincial Bank of Taiwan, and streamlining the [[Taiwan Province|Taiwan Provincial Government]] with most of its functions transferred to the [[Executive Yuan]]. Under Lee, the original members of the [[Legislative Yuan]] and [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]], elected in 1947 to represent mainland Chinese constituencies and having held the seats without re-election for more than four decades, were forced to resign in 1991. The previously nominal representation in the Legislative Yuan was brought to an end, reflecting the reality that the ROC had no jurisdiction over mainland China, and vice versa. Restrictions on the use of [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] in the broadcast media and in schools were also lifted.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Democratic reforms continued in the 1990s, with Lee Teng-hui re-elected in 1996, in the first direct presidential election in the history of the ROC.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/asia_pacific/2000/taiwan_elections2000/1986_1999.stm|title=Taiwan Timeline&nbsp;– Path to democracy|year=2002|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref> During the later years of Lee's administration, he was involved in corruption controversies relating to government release of land and weapons purchase, although no legal proceedings commenced. In 2000, [[Chen Shui-bian]] of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] was elected as the first non-Kuomintang (KMT) President and was re-elected to serve his second and last term since 2004. Polarized politics has emerged in Taiwan with the formation of the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] of parties led by the KMT, favoring eventual [[Chinese reunification]], and the [[Pan-Green Coalition]] of parties led by the DPP, favoring an eventual and official declaration of [[Taiwan independence]].

On 30 September 2007, the ruling DPP approved a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] asserting a separate identity from China and called for the enactment of a new [[constitution]] for a "normal country". It also called for general use of "Taiwan" as the country's name, without abolishing its formal name, the Republic of China.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jF4syWWBWq5u3MZEs-3s9IUT8pGgD8RVKVM80|title=AP, Taiwan Party Asserts Separate Identity}}{{Dead link|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jF4syWWBWq5u3MZEs-3s9IUT8pGgD8RVKVM80|date=May 2009}}</ref> The Chen administration also pushed for referendums on national defense and UN entry in the 2004 and 2008 elections, which failed due to voter turnout below the required legal threshold of 50% of all registered voters.<ref name="lam200803">{{cite journal | last = Lam | first = Willy | title = Ma Ying-jeou and the Future of Cross-Strait Relations | journal = China Brief | volume = 8 | issue = 7 | publisher = Jamestown Foundation | date = 28 March 2008 | url = http://jamestown.org/china_brief/article.php?articleid=2374064 | accessdate = 4 April 2008 | format = &nbsp;– <sup>[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=author%3ALam+intitle%3AMa+Ying-jeou+and+the+Future+of+Cross-Strait+Relations&as_publication=China+Brief&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080413105956/http://www.jamestown.org/china_brief/article.php?articleid=2374064 |archivedate = 13 April 2008 | ref = harv}}</ref> The Chen administration was dogged by public concerns over reduced economic growth, legislative gridlock due to a pan-blue, opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan and corruption involving the First Family as well as government officials.<ref name = "economist20080323">{{cite news | title = The Nationalists are back in Taiwan | newspaper = The Economist | location = London | date = 23 March 2008 }}</ref><ref name = "ft20080325">{{Cite news | title = Straitened times: Taiwan looks to China | newspaper = Financial Times | year = 2008 | date = 03-25 | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/07d43e18-fa9a-11dc-aa46-000077b07658.html}}</ref>

The KMT increased its majority in the Legislative Yuan in the [[Republic of China legislative election, 2008|January 2008 legislative elections]], while its nominee [[Ma Ying-jeou]] went on to [[Republic of China presidential election, 2008|win the presidency]] in March of the same year, campaigning on a platform of increased economic growth, and better ties with the PRC under a policy of "[[Special non-state-to-state relations|mutual nondenial]]".<ref name="lam200803" /> Ma took office on 20 May 2008, the same day that President Chen Shui-bian stepped down and was notified by prosecutors of [[Chen Shui-bian corruption charges|possible corruption charges]].

However, some analysts say that despite the election of Ma Ying-jeou, the diplomatic and military tensions with the PRC have not been reduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/20 August 2009-voa17.cfm |title=Taiwan-China Economic Ties Boom, Military Tensions Remain &#124; English |publisher=Voice of America |date=20 August 2009 |accessdate=1 August 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

[[File:Taiwan NASA Terra MODIS 23791.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Taiwan is mostly mountainous in the east, with gently sloping plains in the west. The [[Penghu Islands]] are west of the main island.]]

The island of Taiwan lies some {{convert|180|km}} off the southeastern coast of mainland China, which lies across the [[Taiwan Strait]], and has an area of {{convert|35883|km2|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="taiwan-popstat"/> The [[East China Sea]] lies to the north, the [[Philippine Sea]] to the east, the [[Luzon Strait]] directly to the south and the [[South China Sea]] to the southwest.<ref name="yb:geography">{{cite book |title=The Republic of China Yearbook |url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/ |chapter=Chapter 1: Geography |chapterurl=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/docs/ch01.pdf |pages=13–25 |publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China (Taiwan) |year=2011}}</ref>
The shape of the main island of Taiwan is similar to a [[sweet potato]] seen in a south-to-north direction, and therefore, Taiwanese (especially [[Min Nan]] speakers) often call themselves "children of the Sweet Potato."<ref>Chao, Kang; Johnson, Marshall (2000). "Nationalist Social Sciences and the Fabrication of Subimperial Subjects in Taiwan." ''Positions'' '''8'''(1) p. 167.</ref>

The island is characterized by the contrast between the eastern two-thirds, consisting mostly of rugged mountains running in five ranges from the northern to the southern tip of the island, and the flat to gently rolling [[Chianan Plain]]s in the west that are also home to most of Taiwan's population. Taiwan's highest point is [[Yu Shan]] (Jade Mountain) at {{convert|3952|m}}, and there are five other peaks over {{convert|3500|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="yb:geography"/> This makes it the world's [[List of islands by highest point|fourth-highest island]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldislandinfo.com/TALLESTV1.htm |title=Tallest Islands of the World&nbsp;— World Island Info web site |publisher=Worldislandinfo.com |accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref>

===Geology===
{{main|Geology of Taiwan}}
[[File:DabajianMountain.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dabajian Mountain]]]]
The island of Taiwan lies in a complex [[tectonics|tectonic]] area between the [[Yangtze Plate]] to the west and north, the [[Okinawa Plate]] on the north-east, and the [[Philippine Mobile Belt]] on the east and south. The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of [[terrane]]s, mostly old [[island arc]]s which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]]. These have been further uplifted as a result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was [[subduction|subducted]] beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust under Taiwan more buoyant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/~anderson/taiwan/tai_index.html |title=Geology of Taiwan&nbsp;— University of Arizona |publisher=Geo.arizona.edu |accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref>

The east and south of Taiwan are a complex system of belts formed by, and part of the zone of, active collision between the North Luzon Trough portion of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc]] and South China, where accreted portions of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc|Luzon Arc]] and Luzon forearc form the [[Haian Range|eastern Coastal Range]] and parallel inland [[Huatung Valley|Longitudinal Valley]] of Taiwan respectively.<ref>Clift, Schouten and Draut (2003) in ''Intra-Oceanic Subduction Systems: Tectonic and Magmatic Processes'', ISBN 1-86239-147-5 p84–86</ref>

The major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between the various [[terrane]]s. These have produced major quakes throughout the history of the island. On 21 September 1999, a 7.3 quake known as the "[[1999 Jiji earthquake|921 earthquake]]" killed more than 2,400 people. The [[seismic hazard map]] for Taiwan by the USGS shows 9/10 of the island as the highest rating (most hazardous).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/GSHAP/eastasia/asiafin.gif |title=USGS seismic hazard map of Eastern Asia |publisher=Seismo.ethz.ch |accessdate=2011-05-30}}</ref>

==Political and legal status==
{{Main|Political status of Taiwan|Legal status of Taiwan}}

The political and legal statuses of Taiwan are contentious issues. The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) claims that the Republic of China government is illegitimate, referring to it as the "Taiwan Authority". The ROC, however, with its own constitution, independently elected president and armed forces, continues to view itself as a [[sovereign state]]. The present territory of the state has never been controlled by the PRC.<ref>{{cite web|year=2005 |title=The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue |work=PRC Taiwan Affairs Office and the Information Office of the State Council |url=http://www.gwytb.gov.cn:8088/detail.asp?table=WhitePaper&title=White%20Papers%20On%20Taiwan%20Issue&m_id=4 |accessdate=2006-03-06}}{{Dead link|date=August 2010}} Section 1: "Since the KMT ruling clique retreated to Taiwan, although its regime has continued to use the designations "Republic of China" and "government of the Republic of China," it has long since completely forfeited its right to exercise state sovereignty on behalf of mainland China and, in reality, has always remained only a separate state on the island of Taiwan."</ref><ref>BBC News, "Taiwan Flashpoint", "But Taiwan's leaders say it is clearly much more than a province, arguing that it is a sovereign state. It has its own constitution, democratically elected leaders, and 400,000 troops in its armed forces."</ref> Internationally, there is controversy on whether the ROC still exists as a state or a defunct state per [[international law]] due to the loss of membership/recognition in the [[United Nations]] and lack of wide [[diplomatic recognition]]. In a poll of Taiwanese aged 20 and older taken by the [[TVBS]] in March 2009, a majority of 64% opted for the status quo, while 19% favored independence and 5% unification.<ref name="tid-tvbs-survey"/>

===Relations with the PRC===
{{See also|Cross-Strait relations}}
The political environment is complicated by the potential for military conflict should Taiwan make overt actions toward de jure independence; it is the official PRC policy to use force to ensure reunification if peaceful reunification is no longer possible, as stated in its [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China|anti-secession law]], and for this reason there are substantial military installations on the [[Fujian]] coast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/china/facility/liancheng.htm|title=Liancheng / Lianfeng Airbase&nbsp;– Chinese Military Forces|publisher=Federation of American Scientists|accessdate=2009-06-07|quote=In March 2000 it was reported that the PLA Air Force was deploying new air-defense missiles [possibly batteries of Russian-made S-300 missiles] opposite Taiwan at the coastal cities of Xiamen and Shantou, and at Longtian, near Fuzhou.}}</ref><ref name=2004NatDefRpt>{{cite web|year=2004 |title=2004 National Defense Report |format=PDF |work=ROC Ministry of National Defense |url=http://report.mnd.gov.tw/eng/pdf/all-1-360.pdf |accessdate=2006-03-05|pages=89–90|quote=The PRC refusal to renounce using military power against Taiwan, its current emphasis on 'enhancing preparation for military struggle', its obvious intention of preparing a war against Taiwan reflected in operational deployment, readiness efforts, and annual military exercises in the Southeast China coastal region, and its progress in aerospace operations, information warfare, paralyzing warfare, and non-conventional warfare, all of these factors work together so that the ROC Armed Forces face an increasingly complicated and difficult situation in terms of self-defense and counterattack. These multiple daunting challenges are testing our defense security. |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060311012134/http://report.mnd.gov.tw/eng/pdf/all-1-360.pdf |archivedate = 11 March 2006}}</ref> Although more recently the PRC has conducted to promote peaceful relation with the current ROC government and aimed at gradual reunification.

The PRC supports a version of the [[One-China policy]], which states that Taiwan and mainland China are both part of China, and that the PRC is the only legitimate government of China. It uses this policy to prevent the international recognition of the ROC as an independent sovereign state. For its part, the People's Republic of China appears to find the retention of the name "Republic of China" more acceptable than an official declaration of an independent Taiwan. With the rise of the Taiwanese independence movement, the name "Taiwan" has been employed increasingly often on the island.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article1475250.ece|title=War of words after call for independence|last=Macartney|first=Jane |date=6 March 2007|newspaper=The Times|accessdate=2009-06-04 | location=London}}</ref>

{{legend|#0080ff|unofficial relations (see text)}}|alt=A map of the world showing countries which have relations with the Republic of China. Only a few small countries recognize the ROC, mainly in Central, South America and Africa.]]
Before 1928, the [[foreign policy]] of Republican China was complicated by a lack of internal unity—competing centers of power all claimed legitimacy. This situation changed after the defeat of the [[Beiyang Government|Peiyang Government]] by the Kuomintang, which led to widespread diplomatic recognition of the Republic of China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.state.gov/countries/china |title=Countries&nbsp;– China|publisher=US Department of State, Office of the Historian|accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref>

After the KMT's retreat to Taiwan, most countries, notably the countries in the [[Western Bloc]], continued to maintain relations with the ROC. Due to diplomatic pressure, recognition gradually eroded and many countries switched recognition to the PRC in the 1970s. [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|UN Resolution 2758]] (25 October 1971) recognized the [[People's Republic of China]] as China's sole representative in the [[United Nations]].<ref>Eyal Propper. [http://israelcfr.com/documents/issue5_china.pdf "How China Views its National Security,"] [[Israel Council on Foreign Relations|The Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs]], May 2008.</ref>

The PRC refuses to have diplomatic relations with any nation that recognizes the ROC, and requires all nations with which it has diplomatic relations to make a statement recognizing its claims to Taiwan.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Henckaerts|first=Jean-Marie|title=The international status of Taiwan in the new world order|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|year=1996|pages=96–97|isbn=90-411-0929-3|url=http://books.google.com/?id=_9kuVIayxDoC&pg=PA96}}</ref> As a result, only {{Numrec|ROC||UN member states}} and the [[Holy See]] maintain official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China. In practice, most countries view the ROC as an independent state and as such maintain unofficial relations with it.<ref>BBC News, "Taiwan Flashpoint", "Given the huge divide between these two positions, most other countries seem happy to accept the current ambiguity, whereby Taiwan has most of the characteristics of an independent state, even if its legal status remains unclear."</ref>

The ROC maintains unofficial relations with most countries via ''[[de facto]]'' [[embassy|embassies]] and [[consul (representative)|consulates]] called [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office]]s (TECRO), with branch offices called "Taipei Economic and Cultural Offices" (TECO). Both TECRO and TECO are "unofficial commercial entities" of the ROC in charge of maintaining [[diplomacy|diplomatic relations]], providing consular services (i.e. visa applications), and serving the national interests of the ROC in other countries.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Vang|first=Pobzeb |title=Five Principles of Chinese Foreign Policies|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4343-6971-0|url=http://books.google.com/?id=TvXlFsxmJiMC|page=46}}</ref>

The [[United States]] is one of the [[Republic of China-United States relations|main allies]] of the ROC and, since the [[Taiwan Relations Act]] passed in 1979, the United States has sold arms and provided military training to the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]].<ref name="TRA-review">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/asiaandthepacific/bg1272.cfm|title=The Taiwan Relations Act After 20 Years: Keys to Past and Future Success|last= Yates|first= Stephen J.|date=16 April 1999|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=2009-07-19}}</ref> This situation continues to be an issue for the People's Republic of China which considers US involvement disruptive to the stability of the region. In January 2010, the Obama administration announced its intention to sell $6.4 billion worth of military hardware to Taiwan. As a consequence, the PRC threatened the US with economic sanctions and warned that their cooperation on international and regional issues could suffer.<ref>{{Cite news|title=China: US spat over Taiwan could hit co-operation |date=2 February 2010 |agency=Agence France-Presse |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jDzKLVZ7X2dz8yrsshklcJZh38Cg}}</ref>

The official position of the United States is that the PRC is expected to "use no force or threat[en] to use force against Taiwan" and the ROC is to "exercise prudence in managing all aspects of [[Cross-Strait relations]]." Both are to refrain from performing actions or espousing statements "that would unilaterally alter Taiwan's status."<ref name="UsPolicyToTaiwan">{{cite press release |publisher=US Department of State |date=21 April 2004|title=Overview of US Policy Towards Taiwan |url=http://www.state.gov/p/eap/rls/rm/2004/31649.htm}}{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>

===Participation in international events and organizations===

The ROC was a founding member of the United Nations and held the [[China and the United Nations|seat of China]] on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] and other UN bodies until 1971, when it was expelled by Resolution 2758 and replaced in all UN organs with the PRC. Each year since 1992, the ROC has petitioned the UN for entry but its applications have not made it past committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taiwandc.org/un-2001.htm |title=Taiwan and the United Nations |publisher=New Taiwan |accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref>

Due to its limited international recognition, the Republic of China is a member of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]], represented by a government-funded organization, the [[Taiwan Foundation for Democracy]] (TFD) under the name "Taiwan".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unpo.org/content/view/7908/146/ |title=Taiwan |publisher=UNPO |accessdate=2009-05-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfd.org.tw/english/about.php|title=About TFD|publisher=TFD}}</ref>

Also due to its One China policy, the PRC only participates in international organizations where the ROC is not recognized as a sovereign country. Most [[Member states of the United Nations|member states]], including the United States, do not wish to discuss the issue of the ROC's political status for fear of souring diplomatic ties with the PRC.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2009/05/13/2003443455 |title=JOHN TKACIK ON TAIWAN: Taiwan’s ‘undetermined’ status|newspaper=Taipei Times |date=13 May 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref> However, both the US and [[Japan]] publicly support the ROC's bid for membership in the [[World Health Organization]] as an observer.<ref>{{Cite news|title=WHO application: a question of health or politics? |date=19 May 2004 |newspaper=Taipei Times |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2004/05/19/2003156094}}</ref> However, though the ROC has applied for WHO membership every year since 1997 under various denominations, their efforts have consistently been blocked by PRC.

===Opinions within Taiwan===
{{See also|Taiwan independence|Chinese reunification}}

Within Taiwan, opinions are polarized between those supporting unification, represented by the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] of parties, and those supporting independence, represented by the [[Pan-Green Coalition]].

The KMT, the largest Pan-Blue party, supports the status quo for the indefinite future with a stated ultimate goal of unification. However, it does not support unification in the short term with the PRC as such a prospect would be unacceptable to most of its members and the public.<ref name="ma-three-noes"/> Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the KMT and the incumbent president of the ROC, has set out democracy, economic development to a level near that of Taiwan, and equitable wealth distribution as the conditions that the PRC must fulfill for reunification to occur.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national%20news/2008/05/16/156644/Unification-with.htm|title=Unification with China unlikely ‘in our lifetimes’: president-elect|last=Enav|first=Peter |date=16 May 2008|newspaper=China Post|accessdate=2009-06-13|quote='It is very difficult for us to see any unification talks even in our lifetimes,' Ma said. 'Taiwanese people would like to have economic interactions with the mainland, but obviously they don’t believe their political system is suitable for Taiwan.'}}</ref>

The [[Democratic Progressive Party]], the largest Pan-Green party, officially seeks independence, but in practice also supports the status quo because its members and the public would not accept the risk of provoking the PRC.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Eckholm |first=Erik |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/22/world/why-a-victory-in-taiwan-wasn-t-enough-for-some.html |title=Why a Victory in Taiwan Wasn't Enough for Some|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 March 2000 |accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |title=Taiwan Flashpoint: Independence debate |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/asia_pac/04/taiwan_flashpoint/html/independence_debate.stm |year=2009 |quote=Since neither outcome looks likely in the short or even medium term, it is perhaps not surprising that opinion polls suggest most Taiwanese people want things to stay as they are, with the island's ambiguous status unresolved.}}</ref>

Former President [[Chen Shui-bian]] of the DPP stated during his years of administration that any decision should be decided through a public referendum of the people of the ROC. Both parties' current foreign policy positions support actively advocating ROC participation in international organizations, but while the KMT accepts the [[One-China policy|One-China]] principle, the DPP encourages the participation of Taiwan as a sovereign state.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

On 2 September 2008, ''El Sol de México'' asked President Ma about his views on the subject of "[[two Chinas]]" and if there was a solution for the sovereignty issues between the two. The president replied that the relations are neither between two Chinas nor two states. It is a [[Special non-state-to-state relations|special relationship]]. Further, he stated that the sovereignty issues between the two cannot be resolved at present, but he quoted the "[[1992 Consensus]]", currently accepted by both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China, as a temporary measure until a solution becomes available.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.oem.com.mx/oem/notas/n836891.htm|title=Impulsa Taiwan la reconciliación|date=2 September 2008|newspaper=El Sol de México|language=Spanish|accessdate=2009-06-09|quote=Esencialmente, no definiríamos la relación a través del estrecho de Taiwan como una relación de dos países o dos Chinas, porque nuestra Constitución no lo permite.

The president appoints the members of the Executive Yuan as his [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], including a [[Premier of the Republic of China|premier]], who is officially the President of the Executive Yuan; members are responsible for policy and administration.<ref name="yb:government"/>

The main [[Legislature|legislative body]] is the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] Legislative Yuan with 113 seats. Seventy-three are elected by popular vote from single-member constituencies; thirty-four are elected based on the proportion of nationwide votes received by participating political parties in a separate party list ballot; and six are elected from two three-member aboriginal constituencies. Members serve four-year terms. Originally the unicameral [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]], as a standing [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] and [[electoral college]], held some [[parliament]]ary functions, but the National Assembly was abolished in 2005 with the power of constitutional amendments handed over to the Legislative Yuan and all eligible voters of the Republic via referendums.<ref name="yb:government"/>

The premier is selected by the president without the need for approval from the legislature, but the legislature can pass laws without regard for the president, as neither he nor the Premier wields veto power.<ref name="yb:government"/> Thus, there is little incentive for the president and the legislature to negotiate on legislation if they are of opposing parties. After the election of the pan-Green's Chen Shui-bian as President in 2000, legislation repeatedly stalled because of deadlock with the Legislative Yuan, which was controlled by a pan-Blue majority.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2006/09/14/2003327608 |title=Letter: KMT holds the key|newspaper=Taipei Times |date=14 September 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref> Historically, the ROC has been dominated by strongman single party politics. This legacy has resulted in executive powers currently being concentrated in the office of the president rather than the premier, even though the constitution does not explicitly state the extent of the president's executive power.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jayasuriya|first=Kanishka|title=Law, capitalism and power in Asia|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|page=217|url=http://books.google.com/?id=OqGSrD9QhXcC&pg=PA217|isbn=978-0-415-19743-4}}</ref>

The Judicial Yuan is the highest [[judiciary|judicial]] organ. It interprets the constitution and other laws and decrees, judges administrative suits, and disciplines public functionaries. The president and vice-president of the Judicial Yuan and additional thirteen justices form the Council of Grand Justices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.president.gov.tw/Default.aspx?tabid=435|title=Article 5 of the Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China (Taiwan)|work=Office of the President|accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref> They are nominated and appointed by the president, with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. The highest court, the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of China|Supreme Court]], consists of a number of civil and criminal divisions, each of which is formed by a presiding judge and four associate judges, all appointed for life. In 1993, a separate [[List of constitutional courts|constitutional court]] was established to resolve constitutional disputes, regulate the activities of political parties and accelerate the democratization process. There is no [[jury trial|trial by jury]] but the right to a fair public trial is protected by law and respected in practice; many cases are presided over by multiple judges.<ref name="yb:government"/>

[[Capital punishment]] is still used in Taiwan, although efforts have been made by the government to reduce the number of executions. Nevertheless, according to a survey in 2006, about 80% of Taiwanese still wanted to keep the death penalty.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/01/02/2003287050|title=Nation keeps death penalty, but reduces executions|last=Chang|first=Rich |date=2 January 2006|newspaper=Taipei Times|accessdate=2009-11-02}}</ref>

The Control Yuan is a watchdog agency that monitors (controls) the actions of the executive. It can be considered a standing [[Government agency|commission]] for administrative inquiry and can be compared to the [[Court of Auditors]] of the [[European Union]] or the [[Government Accountability Office]] of the United States.<ref name="yb:government"/>

The Examination Yuan is in charge of validating the qualification of [[civil servant]]s. It is based on the old [[imperial examination]] system used in dynastic China. It can be compared to the [[European Personnel Selection Office]] of the European Union or the [[Office of Personnel Management]] of the United States.<ref name="yb:government"/>

The constitution of the Republic of China was drafted before the fall of mainland China to the [[Communist]]s. It was created by the KMT for the purpose of all of its claimed territory, including Taiwan, even though the Chinese Communist party boycotted the drafting of the constitution. The constitution went into effect on 25 December 1947.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ginsburg|first=Tom|title=Judicial review in new democracies|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=111|year=2003|isbn=0-521-52039-8|url=http://books.google.com/?id=qJrsouEjOZEC&pg=PA111}}</ref>

The ROC remained under martial law from 1948 until 1987 and much of the constitution was not in effect. Political reforms beginning in the late 1970s and continuing through the early 1990s liberalized the country and transformed into a multiparty democracy. Since the lifting of martial law, the Republic of China has democratized and reformed, suspending constitutional components that were originally meant for the whole of China. This process of amendment continues. In 2000, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[President of the Republic of China|presidency]], ending KMT's continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of constitutional reform to the popular ballot.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Taiwan assembly passes changes |date=7 June 2005 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4616043.stm}}</ref>

The tension between the PRC and Taiwan colors most of the political life, and any government move towards "Taiwan independence" is met by threat of military attack from the PRC.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/country_profiles/1285915.stm|title=Country profile: Taiwan|date=11 September 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 January 2010}}</ref> The PRC's official policy is to [[Chinese reunification|reunify Taiwan and mainland China]] under the formula of "[[one country, two systems]]" and refuses to renounce the use of military force, especially should Taiwan seek a declaration of independence.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fapa.org/chinawp/chinathreatwp223.html|title=China's Threats, Editorial|date=23 February 2000|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=31 October 2011}}</ref>

The political scene is generally divided into two major camps in terms of views on how Taiwan should relate to China or the PRC, referred to as [[Cross-Strait relations]]. It is the main political difference between two camps: the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]], composed of the pro-unification [[Kuomintang]], [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] (PFP), and [[New Party (Republic of China)|New Party]], who believe that the ROC is the sole legitimate government of "China" (including Taiwan) and supports eventual [[Chinese reunification]]. The opposition [[Pan-Green Coalition]] is composed of the pro-independence DPP and [[Taiwan Solidarity Union|Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)]]. It regards Taiwan as an independent, sovereign state [[Four-Stage Theory of the Republic of China|synonymous with the ROC]], opposes the definition that Taiwan is part of "China", and seeks wide [[diplomatic recognition]] and an eventual declaration of formal [[Taiwan independence]].<ref>BBC News, "Taiwan Flashpoint", "Officially, the DPP still favours eventual independence for Taiwan, while the KMT favours eventual re-unification."</ref> The Pan-Green camp tends to favor emphasizing the Republic of China as being a distinct country from the People's Republic of China. Thus, in September 2007, the then ruling Democratic Progressive Party approved a resolution asserting separate identity from China and called for the enactment of a new constitution for a "''normal country''". It called also for general use of "''Taiwan''" as the country's name, without abolishing its formal name, the "Republic of China".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-09-30-taiwan_N.htm |title=Taiwan party asserts separate identity from China |newspaper=USA Today |date=30 September 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-29}}</ref> Some members of the coalition, such as former [[President of the Republic of China|President]] Chen Shui-bian, argue that it is unnecessary to proclaim independence because "Taiwan is already an independent, sovereign country" and the Republic of China is the same as Taiwan.<ref>{{cite web|author=Crisis Group |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=1653&l=1 |title=Taiwan Strait I: What's Left of 'One China'?|publisher=International Crisis Group |date=6 June 2003 |accessdate=2009-05-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080709035143/http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=1653&l=1 |archivedate = 9 July 2008}}</ref> Despite being a member of KMT prior to and during his presidency, [[Lee Teng-hui]] also held a similar view and was a supporter of the [[Taiwanization]] movement.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shirk |first=Susan L.|title=China: Fragile Superpower|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-530609-5}}</ref>

Pan-Blue members generally support the concept of the One-China policy, which states that there is only one China and that its only government is the ROC.

===Current political issues===
The dominant political issue in Taiwan is [[Cross strait relations|its relationship with the PRC]]. For almost 60&nbsp;years, there were no direct transportation links, including direct flights, between Taiwan and mainland China. This was a problem for many Taiwanese businesses that had opened factories or branches in mainland China. The former DPP administration feared that such links would lead to tighter economic and political integration with mainland China, and in the 2006 Lunar New Year Speech, President Chen Shui-bian called for managed opening of links. Direct weekend charter flights between Taiwan and mainland China began in July 2008 under the current KMT government, and the first direct daily charter flights took off in December 2008.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5346905.ece|title=Direct flights between China and Taiwan mark new era of improved relations|last=Yu|first=Sophie|coauthors=Jane Macartney|date=16 December 2008|newspaper=The Times|accessdate=2009-06-04 | location=London}}</ref>

Other major political issues include the passage of an arms procurement bill that the United States authorized in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael S.&nbsp;Chase |url=http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/as.2008.48.4.703?journalCode=as |title=Caliber&nbsp;– Asian Survey&nbsp;– 48(4):703&nbsp;– Abstract |doi=10.1525/as.2008.48.4.703 |publisher=Caliber.ucpress.net |date=4 September 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-29}}</ref> In 2008, however, the United States were reluctant to send over more arms to Taiwan out of fear that it would hinder the recent improvement of ties between the PRC and the ROC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=9556 |title=US Keeps Taiwan at Arm's Length |author=David Isenberg |publisher=Cato.org |accessdate=2009-05-29}}</ref> Another major political issue is the establishment of a National Communications Commission to take over from the Government Information Office, whose advertising budget exercised great control over the media.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/08/09/2003373313 |title=NCC relinquishes power over China-related media|newspaper=Taipei Times |date=9 August 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-29}}</ref>

The politicians and their parties have themselves become major political issues. Corruption among some DPP administration officials has been exposed. In early 2006, President Chen Shui-bian was linked to possible corruption. The political effect on President Chen Shui-bian was great, causing a divide in the DPP leadership and supporters alike. It eventually led to the creation of a political camp led by ex-DPP leader [[Shih Ming-teh]] which believes the president should resign. The KMT assets continue to be another major issue, as it was once the richest political party in the world.<ref>{{Cite journal

===National identity===
{{Main|Taiwanese identity|Chinese nationalism}}

Roughly 84% of Taiwan's population descends from Han Chinese who migrated from mainland China between 1661 and 1895. Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese who immigrated from mainland China in the 1940s and 1950s. The shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences, as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratization and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for ''de jure'' Taiwan independence.<ref name="power-shift">{{Cite book|last=Shambaugh|first=David L.|title=Power shift|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|pages=179–183|url=http://books.google.com/?id=rMicZHVR_y4C&pg=PA179|isbn=0-520-24570-9}}</ref> The [[pan-green]] camp supports a distinct Taiwanese identity, while the [[pan-blue]] camp supports a Chinese identity only.<ref name="panblue-reunif-chineseid"/> The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20081230ho.html|title=No sign of a 'peace agreement'|last=Okazaki|first=Hisahiko|date=30 December 2008|newspaper=Japan Times|accessdate=2009-07-15|quote=For one thing, I believe there is recognition that the awareness of Taiwanese identity is now irreversible.

The [[Republic of China Army]] takes its roots in the [[National Revolutionary Army]], which was established by [[Sun Yat-sen]] in 1925 in [[Guangdong]] with a goal of reunifying China under the Kuomintang. When the [[People's Liberation Army]] won the [[Chinese Civil War]], much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along with the government. It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army. Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army.

Today, the Republic of China maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as defense against the constant threat of invasion by the PRC under the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]].<ref name=2004NatDefRpt/> From 1949 to the 1970s, the primary mission of the military was to "retake the mainland" through [[Project National Glory]]. As this mission has shifted to defense, the ROC military has begun to shift emphasis from the traditionally dominant Army to the [[Republic of China Air Force|air force]] and [[Republic of China Navy|navy]]. Control of the armed forces has also passed into the hands of the civilian government.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB988242686540854310.html?mod=googlewsj |title=Committed to Taiwan |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date= 26 April 2001|accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref> As the ROC military shares historical roots with the KMT, the older generation of high-ranking officers tends to have Pan-Blue sympathies. However, many have retired and there are many more non-mainlanders enlisting in the armed forces in the younger generations, so the political leanings of the military have moved closer to the public norm in Taiwan.<ref>Swaine 2001, p. 65, "The ROC military functioned until very recently as an instrument of KMT rule [and] the bulk of the officer corps is still composed of Mainlanders, many of whom allegedly continue to support the values and outlook of more conservative KMT and New Party members. This is viewed as especially the case among the senior officers of the ROC Army. Hence, many DPP leaders insist that the first step to building a more secure Taiwan is to bring the military more fully under civilian control, to remove the dominant influence of conservative KMT elements, and to reduce what is regarded as an excessive emphasis on the maintenance of inappropriate ground force capabilities, as opposed to more appropriate air and naval capabilities."</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Administrative divisions of the Republic of China}}
{{Taiwan Labelled Map}}

According to the 1947 constitution, written and promulgated whilst the ROC government still controlled mainland China, the territory of the ROC consisted of [[Province (China)|provinces]], [[Special municipality (Republic of China)|special municipalities]], as well as [[Mongolia]]<ref name=art119>[[s:Constitution of the Republic of China#Section 1. The Province|Article 119]] of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] regards Mongolia as a self-governing provincial-level locality</ref> and [[Tibet]]. Accordingly, when the ROC retreated to Taiwan in 1949, its claimed territory consisted of 35 provinces, 12 special municipalities, 1 special administrative region, as well as Mongolia<ref name=art119/> and Tibet. However, since its retreat, the ROC has controlled only [[Taiwan Province]] and some islands of [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian Province]]. The ROC also controls the [[Pratas Islands]] (Dong-Sha) and [[Taiping Island]] in the [[Spratly Islands]], which are part of the disputed [[South China Sea Islands]]. They were placed under [[Kaohsiung]] administration after the retreat to Taiwan.<ref>{{Cite news|title=World: Asia-Pacific Analysis: Flashpoint Spratly |date=14 February 1999 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/279170.stm}}</ref>

Since 1949, the government has made some changes in the area under its control. [[Taipei]] became a special municipality in 1967 and Kaohsiung in 1979. The two provincial governments were "streamlined", with their functions transferred to the central government (Fujian in 1956 and Taiwan in 1998).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1465&CtNode=1347 | work=Taiwan Review | title=Gone with the Times | date=1 October 1999 | accessdate=13 April 2012 | last=Hwang | first=Jim}}</ref> In 2010, [[New Taipei]], [[Taichung]] and [[Tainan]] were upgraded to [[Special municipality of Taiwan|special municipalities]].

The quick industrialization and rapid growth of Taiwan during the latter half of the 20th century has been called the "[[Taiwan Miracle]]". Taiwan is one of the "[[Four Asian Tigers]]" alongside [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]] and [[Singapore]].

Japanese rule prior to and during World War II brought changes in the public and private sectors, most notably in the area of public works, which enabled rapid communications and facilitated transport throughout much of the island. The Japanese also improved public education and made it compulsory for all Taiwanese citizens.

By 1945, [[hyperinflation]] was in progress in mainland China and Taiwan as a result of the war with Japan. To isolate Taiwan from it, the Nationalist government created a new currency area for the island, and started a price stabilization program. These efforts helped significantly slow the inflation.

When the KMT government fled to Taiwan it brought millions of taels of gold and the foreign currency reserve of mainland China to the island, which, according to the KMT stabilized prices and reduced hyperinflation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gold Shipped to Taiwan in 1949 Helped Stabilize ROC on Taiwan|url=http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&mnum=112&anum=9442|newspaper=Kuomintang News Network|accessdate=14 June 2011}}</ref> Perhaps more importantly, as part of its retreat to Taiwan, the KMT brought the intellectual and business elites from Mainland China.<ref>{{cite book | last =Roy | first =Denny | title =Taiwan: A Political History | publisher =Cornell University Press |year=2003 | location =Ithaca, NY | pages =76, 77 | isbn =0-8014-8805-2 }}</ref> The KMT government instituted many laws and land reforms that it had never effectively enacted on mainland China. The government also implemented a policy of [[import substitution industrialization|import-substitution]], attempting to produce imported goods domestically.

In 1950, with the outbreak of the Korean War, the US began an aid program which resulted in fully stabilized prices by 1952.<ref>{{harvnb|Makinen|Woodward|1989}}: "It was the fiscal regime change on Taiwan, as in the European episodes, that finally brought price stability. It was the aid program that brought the budget to near balance, and when the aid program reached its full proportions in 1952, prices stabilized."</ref> Economic development was encouraged by American economic aid and programs such as the [[Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction]], which turned the agricultural sector into the basis for later growth. Under the combined stimulus of the land reform and the agricultural development programs, agricultural production increased at an average annual rate of 4 per cent from 1952 to 1959, which was greater than the population growth, 3.6 percent.<ref>Ralph Clough, “Taiwan under Nationalist Rule, 1949–1982,” in Roderick MacFarquar et al., ed., ''Cambridge History of China'', Vol 15, The People’s Republic Pt 2 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), p. 837</ref>

In 1962, Taiwan had a (nominal) per-capita gross national product (GNP) of $170, placing its economy on a par with those of Zaire and Congo. On a PPP basis, its GDP per capita in early 1960s is $1353 (in 1990 constant prices).<ref>{Angus. Madison}</ref> By 2011 per-capita GNP, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP), had risen to $37,000, contributing to a [[Human Development Index]] equivalent to that of other developed countries. Taiwan's HDI in 2007 is 0.943 (25th, very high),<ref>As calculated by Taiwan's Ministry of Budget, National Accountancy and Statistics, based on the following figures (2007): life expectancy / 78.4 years ; literacy rate / 97.6% ; gross combined schooling rate / 101.9% ; per capita GDP-PPP / US$30,352</ref> and stands at 0.868 in 2010 (18th, very high), according to the UN's new calculating method ("Inequality-adjusted HDI").
In 1974, Chiang Ching-kuo implemented the [[Ten Major Construction Projects]], the beginning foundations that helped Taiwan transform into its current export driven economy.

Today Taiwan has a dynamic, capitalist, export-driven economy with gradually decreasing state involvement in investment and foreign trade. In keeping with this trend, some large government-owned banks and industrial firms are being [[Privatization|privatized]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1153&CtNode=128|title=Privatization Set in Motion|last=Her|first=Kelly|date=12 January 2005|newspaper=Taiwan Review|accessdate=2009-06-05}}</ref> Real growth in [[gross domestic product|GDP]] has averaged about 8% during the past three decades.

Since the beginning of the 1990s, the economic ties between Taiwan and Mainland China have been very prolific. As of 2008, more than US$150 billion<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/8475215.stm|title=Taiwan's Grand Hotel welcome for Chinese visitors|publisher=BBC News|date=23 January 2010 | first=Phil | last=Harding}}</ref> have been invested in the PRC by Taiwanese companies, and about 10% of the Taiwanese labour force works in the PRC, often to run their own businesses.<ref>{{Harvnb|DoIT|2008|p=5}} "Notably, cross-strait political tensions have not prevented Taiwanese firms from investing heavily in China. The cross-strait investments now exceed US$ 100 billions. Four Taiwanese-owned firms rank among China's top 10 biggest exporters. 10% of the Taiwanese labor force now works in China."</ref> Although the economy of Taiwan benefits from this situation, some have expressed the view that the island has become increasingly dependent on the Mainland Chinese economy. A 2008 white paper by the Department of Industrial Technology states that "Taiwan should seek to maintain stable relation with China while continuing to protect national security, and avoiding excessive 'Sinicization' of Taiwanese economy."<ref>{{Harvnb|DoIT|2008|p=5}} "Although used-to-be-hostile tension between Taiwan and China has been eased to a certain degree, Taiwan should seek to maintain stable relation with China while continuing to protect national security, and avoiding excessive "Sinicization" of Taiwanese economy. Strategies to avoid excessive "Sinicization" of the Taiwanese economy could include efforts to increase geographic diversity of overseas Taiwanese employment, diversifying Taiwan's export markets and investment. "</ref> Others argue that close economic ties between Taiwan and Mainland China would make any military intervention by the PLA against Taiwan very costly, and therefore less probable.<ref>BBC News, "Taiwan Flashpoint", "Some Taiwanese worry their economy is now dependent on China. Others point out that closer business ties makes Chinese military action less likely, because of the cost to China's own economy."</ref>

Taiwan’s total trade in 2010 reached an all-time high of US$526.04 billion, according to Taiwan's Ministry of Finance. Both exports and imports for the year reached record levels, totaling US$274.64 billion and US$251.4 billion, respectively.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=142731&ctNode=453&mp=9|title=Taiwan's 2010 trade hits record high|newspaper=Taiwan Today|date=10 January 2010}}</ref>

It is estimated that some 50,000&nbsp;Taiwanese businesses and 1,000,000&nbsp;businesspeople and their dependents are established in the PRC.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Morris |first=Peter |title=Taiwan business in China supports opposition |date=4 February 2004 |newspaper=Asia Times Online |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FB04Ad04.html}}</ref>

Because of its conservative financial approach and its entrepreneurial strengths, Taiwan suffered little compared with many of its neighbors from the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]]. Unlike its neighbors, South Korea and Japan, the Taiwanese economy is dominated by small and medium sized businesses, rather than the large business groups. The global economic downturn, however, combined with poor policy coordination by the new administration and increasing bad debts in the banking system, pushed Taiwan into [[recession]] in 2001, the first whole year of negative growth since 1947. Due to the relocation of many manufacturing and labor intensive industries to the PRC, unemployment also reached a level not seen since the 1970s oil crisis. This became a major issue in the [[Republic of China presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]]. Growth averaged more than 4% in the 2002–2006 period and the unemployment rate fell below 4%.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5411/is_199801/ai_n21432097/ |title=Coping with Asian financial crisis: The Taiwan experience &#124; Seoul Journal of Economics |publisher=Find Articles at BNET |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-28}}{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref>

==Transportation==
{{Main|Transportation in Taiwan}}
The [[Ministry of Transportation and Communications (Republic of China)|Ministry of Transportation and Communications]] of the Republic of China is the cabinet-level governing body for the transportation network in Taiwan. Highways in Taiwan can be classified into five levels: National highways, provincial highways, county routes, township routes, and special routes, with the first four being common. Taiwan has an extensive rail network, which is managed by the [[Taiwan Railway Administration]] with the exception of the [[high-speed rail]] line, which is run by [[Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation]]. [[Taipei Metro]] and the [[Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit]] serve the [[Taipei metropolitan area]] and the city of Kaohsiung, respectively, and [[Taichung Metro]] is currently under construction. Major airports include [[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport]], [[Taipei Songshan Airport]], [[Kaohsiung International Airport]], and [[Taichung Airport]]. The four international seaports are the [[Port of Keelung]], the [[Port of Kaohsiung]], the [[Port of Taichung]], and the [[Port of Hualien]].

The higher education system was established in Taiwan by Japan during the colonial period. However, after the Republic of China took over Taiwan from Japan in 1945, the system was promptly replaced by the same system as in mainland China which mixed with features of the Chinese and American educational systems.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Postiglione|first=Gerard A.|coauthors=Grace C.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Taiwan}}
Taiwan's population was estimated in 2012 at 23,261,747, most of whom are on the island of Taiwan. The remainder live on [[Penghu]] (97,724), [[Kinmen]] (108,147) and the [[Matsu Islands]] (10,253).<ref name="taiwan-popstat"/>

===Ethnic groups===
{{Main|Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwanese people}}
[[File:Taiwan bunun dancer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bunun people|Bunun]] dancer in traditional aboriginal dress]]
About 98% of Taiwan's population is of [[Han Chinese]] [[ethnicity]].<ref name="cia-factbook"/> Of these, 86% are descendants of early Han Chinese immigrants known as the "''benshengren''" ({{zh|c=本省人|p=Běnshěng rén|l=home-province person}}) in Chinese.<ref name="cia-factbook"/> This group is often referred to "native Taiwanese" in English, but the term is also frequently used for the Taiwanese aborigines. The ''benshengren'' group contains two subgroups: the [[Hoklo people]] (70% of the total population), whose ancestors migrated from the coastal southern [[Fujian]] (Min-nan) region in the southeast of [[mainland China]] starting in the 17th century, and the [[Hakka people|Hakka]] (15% of the total population), whose ancestors originally migrated south to [[Guangdong]], its surrounding areas and Taiwan.<ref name="cia-factbook"/>

About 12% of the population are known as ''waishengren'' ({{zh|c=外省人|p=Wàishěng rén|l=out-of-province person}}), composed of people who [[Military dependents' village|emigrated from mainland China]] after 1945.<ref name="cia-factbook"/>

The other 2.25% of the population are about 522,942 [[Taiwanese aborigines]], divided into 14 major groups. The [[Ami people|Ami]], [[Atayal people|Atayal]], [[Bunun people|Bunun]], [[Kavalan people|Kavalan]], [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]], [[Puyuma people|Puyuma]], [[Rukai people|Rukai]], [[Saisiyat people|Saisiyat]], [[Sakizaya people|Sakizaya]], [[Sediq people|Sediq]], [[Thao people|Thao]], [[Truku people|Truku]] and [[Tsou people|Tsou]] live mostly in the eastern half of the island, while the [[Yami people|Yami]] inhabit [[Orchid Island]].<ref name="cia-factbook"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sowf.moi.gov.tw/stat/month/m1-04.xls |title=Indigenous People |publisher=MOI Statistical Information Service |date=Feb 2012 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=An Overview of Taiwan's Indigenous Groups |url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/culture/indigenous/ |publisher=Government Information Office |location=Taipei |year=2006 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref>

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Taiwan}}

[[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] is the official national language and is spoken by the vast majority of the population of Taiwan. It has been the primary language of instruction in schools since the Japanese were forced out in the 1940s. As in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], [[Traditional Chinese]] is used in Taiwan.<ref name="yb-languages">[http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/docs/ch02D.pdf Languages], ''The Republic of China Yearbook 2011'', Government Information Office, Republic of China (Taiwan).</ref>

Most Waishengren speak primarily Mandarin. The 70% of the population belonging to the [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] ethnic group speak [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] (a variant of the [[Min Nan]] speech of [[Fujian]] province) as their mother tongue, in addition to Mandarin, and many others have some degree of understanding. The Hakka ethnic group (15% of the population) use the [[Hakka (language)|Hakka language]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Lynn F.

Taiwan's indigenous languages, the [[Formosan languages]], do not belong to the Chinese or Sino-Tibetan language family, but rather to the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]]. Their use among Taiwan's aboriginal minority groups has been in decline as usage of Mandarin has risen.<ref name="yb-languages"/> Of the 14 extant languages, five are considered [[language death|moribund]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Formosan Language Archive: Linguistic Analysis and Language Processing |author1=Zeitoun, Elizabeth |author2=Yu, Ching-Hua |journal=Computational Linguistics and Chinese Language Processing |volume=10 |issue=2 |page=168 |url=http://aclclp.org.tw/clclp/v10n2/v10n2a2.pdf |accessdate=4 August 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Confucius temple Kaohsiung amk.jpg|thumb|[[Confucian temple]] at [[Lotus Lake]] in [[Kaohsiung]]]]
[[Confucianism]] is a philosophy that deals with secular moral ethics, and serves as the foundation of both [[Culture of China|Chinese]] and [[Culture of Taiwan|Taiwanese culture]]. The majority of [[Taiwanese people]] usually combine the secular moral teachings of Confucianism with whatever religions they are affiliated with.

As of 2009, there are 14,993 temples in Taiwan, approximately one place of worship per 1,500 residents. 9,202 of those temples were dedicated to [[Taoism]]. In 2008, Taiwan had 3,262 Churches, an increase of 145.<ref>[http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=1015081&lang=eng_news&cate_img=logo_taiwan&cate_rss=TAIWAN_eng "15,000 temples"], ''Taiwan News'', 28 July 2009.

==Public health==
{{Main|Healthcare in Taiwan}}
[[Health care]] in Taiwan is managed by the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI).<ref>{{Cite news|title=Bureau of National Health Insurance |date=18 July 2006 |publisher=Taiwan BNHI |url=http://www.nhi.gov.tw}}</ref>

The current program was implemented in 1995, and is considered to be a form of social insurance. The government health insurance program maintains compulsory insurance for citizens who are employed, impoverished, unemployed, or victims of natural disasters with fees that correlate to the individual and/or family income; it also maintains protection for non-citizens working in Taiwan. A standardized method of calculation applies to all persons and can optionally be paid by an employer or by individual contributions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhi.gov.tw/english/webdata.asp?menu=11&menu_id=295&webdata_id=1865 |title=Bureau of National Health Insurance-National Health Insurance Act |publisher=Bureau of National Health Insurance, ROC |accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref>

BNHI insurance coverage requires co-payment at the time of service for most services unless it is a preventative health service, for low-income families, veterans, children under three years old, or in the case of catastrophic diseases. Low income households maintain 100% premium coverage by the BNHI and co-pays are reduced for disabled or certain elderly peoples.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

According to a recently published survey, out of 3,360&nbsp;patients surveyed at a randomly chosen hospital, 75.1% of the patients said they are "very satisfied" with the hospital service; 20.5% said they are "okay" with the service. Only 4.4% of the patients said they are either "not satisfied" or "very not satisfied" with the service or care provided.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Taiwanese Hospital Public Satisfaction Poll |date=October 2004|publisher=Taiwan Department of Health |url=http://www.hcquality.helthe.net/reports/showreports.php?id=2_1}}{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>

Taiwan has its own Center for Disease Control, and during the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] outbreak in March 2003 there were 347&nbsp;confirmed cases.

After their move to Taiwan, the [[Kuomintang]] imposed an official interpretation of traditional Chinese culture over Taiwan. The government launched a [[History of the Kuomintang cultural policy|program]] promoting [[Chinese calligraphy]], [[Chinese painting|traditional Chinese painting]], [[Chinese folk art|folk art]], and [[Chinese opera]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The status of Taiwanese culture is debated.<ref>(Yip 2004:230–248; Makeham 2005:2–8; Chang 2005:224)</ref> It is disputed whether Taiwanese culture is a regional form of Chinese culture or a distinct culture. Reflecting the continuing controversy surrounding the [[political status of Taiwan]], politics continues to play a role in the conception and development of a Taiwanese cultural identity, especially in the prior dominant frame of a Taiwanese and [[China|Chinese]] dualism. In recent years, the concept of Taiwanese [[multiculturalism]] has been proposed as a relatively apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought and behavior shared by the people of Taiwan.<ref>{{Harvcol|Makeham|Hsiau|2005|pp=125–129}}; (Winckler 1994:23–41)</ref> [[Identity politics]], along with the over one hundred years of political separation from mainland China, has led to distinct traditions in many areas, including [[Taiwanese cuisine|cuisine]] and [[Music of Taiwan|music]].

One of Taiwan's greatest attractions is the [[National Palace Museum]], which houses more than 650,000 pieces of Chinese bronze, jade, calligraphy, painting and porcelain, and is considered one of the greatest collections of Chinese art and objects in the world.<ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557357_9/museum.html ]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> The KMT moved this collection from the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing in 1933 and part of the collection was eventually transported to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. The collection, estimated to be one-tenth of China's cultural treasures, is so extensive that only 1% is on display at any time. The PRC had said that the collection was stolen and has called for its return, but the ROC has long defended its control of the collection as a necessary act to protect the pieces from destruction, especially during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Relations regarding this treasure have warmed recently; Beijing Palace Museum Curator Zheng Xinmiao said that artifacts in both Chinese and Taiwanese museums are "China's cultural heritage jointly owned by people across the Taiwan Strait."<ref>{{cite news

The classical music culture in Taiwan is highly developed and features artists such as violinist [[Cho-Liang Lin]], pianist [[Ching-Yun Hu]], and the Lincoln Center Chamber Music Society Artist Director [[Wu Han (pianist)|Wu Han]]. [[Karaoke]], drawn from contemporary Japanese culture, is extremely popular in Taiwan, where it is known as KTV. KTV businesses operate in a hotel-like style, renting out small rooms and ballrooms varying on the number of guests in a group. Many KTV establishments partner with restaurants and buffets to form all-encompassing elaborate evening affairs for families, friends, or businessmen. Tour buses that travel around Taiwan have several TV's, equipped not for watching movies, but primarily for singing Karaoke. The entertainment counterpart of a KTV is an MTV, being found much less frequently out of the city. There, movies out on DVD can be selected and played in a private theater room. However MTV, more so than KTV, has a growing reputation for being a place that young couples will go to be alone and intimate.

{{Main|Minguo calendar}}
{{See also|Chinese calendar|Public holidays in Taiwan}}

Taiwan uses two official calendars: the [[Gregorian calendar]], and the [[Minguo calendar]]. The latter numbers years starting from 1911, the year of the founding of the Republic of China. For example, 2007 is the "96th year of the Republic",<ref>{{cite web|author=Lotta Danielsson-Murphy |url=http://www.us-taiwan.org/taiwan_holidays.html |title=Taiwan Calendar and Holidays |publisher=US-Taiwan Business Council |accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref> while its months and days are numbered according to the Gregorian calendar.

Usually, year numbering may use the Gregorian system as well as the ROC era system. For example, 3 May 2004, may be written 2004-05-03 or 93–05–03. The use of two different calendar systems in Taiwan may be confusing, in particular for foreigners. For instance, products for export marked using the Minguo calendar can be misunderstood as having an expiration date 11&nbsp;years earlier than intended.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2006/02/25/2003294523 |title=Taiwan may drop idiosyncratic Republican calendar|newspaper=Taipei Times |date=25 February 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref>

Taiwan also uses the [[lunar calendar]] for traditional festivals such as the [[Chinese New Year]], the [[Lantern Festival]], and the [[Dragon Boat Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/festival_c/index_e.htm |title=Holidays and Festivals in Taiwan |publisher=Government Information Office, ROC|accessdate=2009-05-28}}</ref>
