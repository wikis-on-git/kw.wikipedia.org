'''China''' {{Audio|zh-zhongguo.ogg|listen}} ({{zh-tspw|t=中國|s=中国|p=Zhōngguó|w=Chung-kuo}}) refers to a number of states and cultures that have existed and are viewed as having succeeded one another in [[continent]]al [[East Asia]] for the last 4000 years. Depending on one's point of view, modern China can be described as a single [[civilization]] or multiple civilizations, as a single [[state]] or multiple states, and as a single [[nation]] or multiple nations.

China is one of the world's oldest civilizations, with a history characterized by repeated divisions and reunifications amid alternating periods of peace and war and violent [[imperial]] [[Chinese dynasty|dynastic]] change. The [[country]]'s territorial extent expanded outwards from a core area in the [[North China Plain]], and varied according to its moving fortunes. For centuries, China was one of the world's most [[technology|technologically]] advanced civilizations, and East Asia's dominant [[culture|cultural]] influence.  However, by the [[19th century|nineteenth]] and early [[20th century|twentieth centuries]], China stagnated and fell behind, and was too weak militarily to repel [[Europe]]an interference or [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]ese invasion. Imperial monarchy in China ended with the establishment of the [[Republic of China]] in [[1912]]; however the next four decades were marred by warlordism, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], and the [[Chinese Civil War]].

The [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]] in [[1949]] established the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in [[1949]] which has since then governed [[mainland China]]. The PRC has also assumed sovereignty over [[Hong Kong]] in [[1997]] and [[Macau]] in [[1999]]. In the mean time, the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) government was forced to flee the mainland and retreat to Taiwan, which it had governed since the end of World War II. Since then the ROC has maintained control over Taiwan and the [[Pescadores]], islands off the coast of [[Fujian]], and some islands in the South China Sea. The PRC does not recognize the ROC, as it claims to be the sole successor of all China including Taiwan. On the other hand, the ROC, while never formally surrendering its claims, has moved away from its former identity as the ruler of China, and increasingly characterizes itself as ''[[Taiwan]]'', which is also the usage commonly adopted in the West (see [[political status of Taiwan]] for more information). The nature and extent of ''China'' is the subject of ongoing political disputes on [[Chinese reunification]]/[[Taiwan independence]] issues. -->
