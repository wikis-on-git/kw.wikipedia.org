<!-- Birds range in size from the tiny [[hummingbird]]s to the huge [[Ostrich]] and [[Emu]]. Depending on taxonomic viewpoint, there are about 8,800-10,200 living bird species (plus about 120-130 that have become [[extinction|extinct]] in the span of human history) in the world, making them the most diverse class of terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s.

Birds are a very differentiated class, with some feeding on [[nectar]], [[plant]]s, seeds, [[insect]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[fish]], carrion, or other birds. Most birds are [[diurnal]], or active during the day. Some birds, such as the [[owl]]s and [[nightjar]]s, are [[nocturnal]] or [[crepuscular]] (active during twilight hours). Many birds [[bird migration|migrate]] long distances to utilise optimum habitats (e.g., [[Arctic Tern]]) while others spend almost all their time at sea (e.g. the [[Wandering Albatross]]). Some, such as [[frigatebird]]s, stay aloft for days at a time, even sleeping on the wing.

Common characteristics of birds include  a bony [[beak]] with no teeth, the laying of hard-shelled [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s, high [[metabolism|metabolic]] rate, and a light but strong [[skeleton]].  Most birds are characterised by [[bird flight|flight]], though the [[ratite]]s are flightless, and several other species, particularly on islands, have also lost this ability. Flightless birds include the [[penguin]]s, Ostrich, [[kiwi]], and the extinct [[Dodo]]. Flightless species are vulnerable to extinction when humans or the [[mammal]]s they introduce arrive in their habitat, for example the [[Great Auk]], flightless [[Rallidae|rail]]s, and the [[moa]] of [[List of New Zealand birds|New Zealand]]. -->
