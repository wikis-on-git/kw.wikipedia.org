<!-- ORIGINAL TEXT: William Rowe was a Farmer who lived in Sancreed and who spoke Cornish as his Mother Tongue (mammyeth). Although he and his wife both spoke Cornish and he was involved in the preservation of the language, both he and his wife refused to teach the language to their children. Such was the politics of the time, that to be Cornish was to be a second class citizen. Some relatives even changed their name to appear more English.

Born in 1660 on St.Buryan he wrote under the name of Willow Kereve, which family tradition states is the Cornish version of William Rowe. Various publications write it as Willow Kerew or most commonly Wella Rowe. Stories of his life and family history as well as his translations have been passed down through the generations of his family. Some of his descendants still speak Cornish today. Details of his family history and his bible translations can be found at www.cornishlanguage.co.uk.

Somewhere hopefully is his cornish - english vocabulary written in the late 17th century together with a history of his family wriiten by his grandson in 1830. Totalling 354 pages this manuscript was last seen in Boston in 1830 in the hands of John Rowe Needham. This document could well hold previously unknown Cornish words and as such would be priceless to the the Cornish language movement.-->
